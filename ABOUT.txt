Mormon Documentation Project - LDS Scriptures
---------------------------------------------

This package contains the standard works of The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints including:

	Holy Bible: Kings James Version (Old and New Testaments)
	The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ
	Doctrine and Covenants
	Pearl of Great Price

In order to make the text in the database computer and HTML-friendly,
there have been some slight modifications made that differ from the
actual printed text in current book format.  The original FORMAT has been
preserved as much as possible, and the SCRIPTURAL TEXT has been wholly
untouched.  All modifications have been documented in the changelog.

The Scriptures are part of the public domain, and so are all original
works included in this package.  Enjoy! :)

See the INSTALL file for information about each export.

See http://scriptures.nephi.org/documentation/ for documentation.

Please remember to treat the Scriptures with the respect they deserve.
