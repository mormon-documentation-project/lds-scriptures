and it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am permitted to speak unto you at this time."},{"number":3,"scriptureText":"Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the church, that are the peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient hope by which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven."},{"number":4,"scriptureText":"And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of your peaceable walk with the children of men."},{"number":5,"scriptureText":"For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them;

How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?"},{"number":41,"scriptureText":"And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise."},{"number":42,"scriptureText":"Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope."},{"number":43,"scriptureText":"And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart."},{"number":44,"scriptureText":"If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity."},{"number":45,"scriptureText":"And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."},{"number":46,"scriptureText":"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth.
